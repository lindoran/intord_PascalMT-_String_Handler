MODULE io_main;
{intord - this adds some needed functionality to pascal/mt+ also reqired
 to include a table module for your specific processor type. in this version
 there is 8080, as well as 8086.  This is done as there is a 8 byte offset
 to the dummy procedure routine technique described in the programmers
 refrence. within that module there is a procedure that generates the 
 pointers for all the table data which must be exicuted prior to including.

 there's likely a way to do that automatically with mechine code, but as 
 it is just a look up table its not going to be any faster, so its low 
 on my priority list right now.  if sombody wants to write in drop in 
 table modules that build the data in memory and estabish the pointers
 without calling them it might be a good project if you are incredibly bored.
