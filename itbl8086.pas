MODULE io_tables_8086;
 {                    intord lookup tables module

  here are the custom lookup tables for the 8086/8 useing the technique
  described in 'Pascal/MT+ Programmers Reference for DOS'. Pascal/MT+ 
  has no typed constants, and therefor you can not declare a constant
  table in memory. you need to include one of these (8088 or 8086) at 
  link time, along with the apropreate .tdf and .def files in their
  respective locations in the declaration block of your code. you 
  only need to include the .vdf if you need to use these tables in 
  your code (and if you need them they are much faster than a set,
  so I recomend it.)

  additionally, you need to call 'imkptrs' prior to using any function
  or procedure that uses these tables.

{$I intord.tdf}
 { we need a bunch of kludged pointers to manipulate the offset by 
   8 bytes, due to how pascal/mt+ handles procedure return calls. 
   this only works on the 8086.  I have no idea how this works on the
   68k.
   
   a better way to do this would be to build these tables in asembly language
   as a module, but as i've mentioned before; execution would not be faster
   as you can not get faster than looking up a value but it would avoid 
   declaring the pointers which would save some memory perhapse. }
